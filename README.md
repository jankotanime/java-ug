# University Java Projects

This repository contains a collection of small projects created as part of University of Gdansk course **Object-Oriented and Functional Programming**. Each project focuses on a different task or problem and is intended to help practice programming skills. All projects have been written from scratch by me. Most of the projects combine both object-oriented and functional programming paradigms.
